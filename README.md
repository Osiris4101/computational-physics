### Trying to use JS for Computational Science.

I plan to put together a library for Computational Physics in JavaScript. The aim is to include everything I could from the applied parts of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics; so it would probably be a "work in progress" till the end of time - science has always been a work in progress. I would only be coding the parts where the libraries already available are very old or inefficient/incomplete in my perspective. 
I to start with General Physics and Chemistry and move on to branch-specific problems. This process is probably going to be random, I haven't decided on which branch/topics to touch first.

I am rather illeterate when it comes to Biology, so if someone capable wants to bring in Biology and collaborate, I'd welcome with open arms.

You may find other solutions, or collections of solutions; serving a similar purpose - so don't hate me for 'doing stuff my way' when a solution existed already or because you can find similarities between my work and others', I would find it severely unethical to claim someone else's work as mine. But so it happens, I might get inspired by someone's work, or see a better/more efficient solution for a similar problem. In such cases I'd be attributing the inspiration, or the source. If I miss out any, please let me know.

### External Libraries
These are the libraries I plan to use, or have already started using in this project.
